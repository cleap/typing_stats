# Typing Stats
Typing stats is a package that tracks typing statistics. 
I hope to use this to help design a more effecient keyboard design suited to any individuals specific typing needs.

# Future goals
* Store typed key frequencies (csv?)
* Store n-gram (or Markov Chains?) frequencies
* Visualize data in real-time and automatically backup information with jupyter style interface
